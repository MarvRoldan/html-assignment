                <strong>"Marvins Room"</strong>is a song by Canadian recording artist Drake. It is the lead single from Drake's second studio album Take Care. Produced by 40, it features keyboard-based instrumentation and muted bass. 
                "Marvins Room" is performed from the point of view of an inebriated Drake as he calls up an ex-girlfriend and rants about his various frustrations and loneliness. Adrian Eccleston and Gonzales provide additional musical contributions to the song. 
                It was initially posted by Drake to his October's Very Own blog on June 9, 2011. Positive public reception to the song prompted its release as a single on June 28 to urban contemporary radio and as a digital download. 
                "Marvins Room" was later included on Drake's second studio album Take Care, where it is followed by an interlude entitled "Buried Alive". The song features uncredited vocals from singer Ericka Lee.
